# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project 3

This is the first project in "M2M and IoT Interface Design and Protocols" (ECEA 5348), and picks up where Project 2 from ECEA 5347 left off. I have included four files:
  1.  UCB5348-Pseudosensor-Project1.pdf: Project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the UI in several scenarios.
  2.  boto_retrieve.py:   
  4.  pseudosensor.py: Starter code used to generate pseudorandom weather information. I decided to use the class-supplied file this time rather than my own code, just to mix things up a bit. 
  5.  publish_final.py: 

# What I learned

Unlike prior projects, there was a lot of unfamiliar tech here for me. To start, AWS is a very, VERY large platform (I suppose that's to be expected from a sister company to one of the world's largest companies). Secondary to that, though, I found it difficult to scavenge through AWS documentation to find what I needed. There are also many AWS tutorials available, but finding information for a specific use case can be a challenge.
